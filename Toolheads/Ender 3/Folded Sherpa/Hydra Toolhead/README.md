# Ender 3 - Hydra Mount - Folded Sherpa Edition

This is a simple adaption of the head-part of the [Hydra Fanduct](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4062242) to fit a Folded Sherpa on the toolhead. 
Two versions exist - one for just the folded sherpa and a second version with additional support for a [carabiner-toolboard](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex_Engineering_PCBs/tree/master/carabiner-toolboard)

# Mounting Hardware

The following parts are required to mount a folded Sherpa on the head:
- 2x Heatset Inserts (M3xL4.0xD5.0)
- 1x M3x12mm Screw
- 1x M3x10mm Screw

The following parts are required in addition to the ones above mounting the carabiner on the mount:
- 2x Heatset Inserts (M3xL4.0xD5.0)
- 2xM3x8mm Screws (6mm are also ok)

# Adapting the .step files
Both versions of the toolhead have a .step / f3z-file provided to allow for simple adaption. 
The following parameters are intended to be adapted:
- HeatsetDiameter: Diameter of your heatset-inserts. If printing in ABS simpy insert the diameter of your heatset-inserts, otherwise substract 0.2mm
- ScrewHeadDiameter: Diameter of the countersunk screws. Provided 6mm is for m3 buttonhead screws
- ScrewHeadDepth: Depth for the countersunk screws. Provided 2mm is for m3 buttonhead screws.
